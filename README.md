# Country Roads - Finding the Fastest Path Using A*

## Project Overview
This project uses the **A* search algorithm** to find the fastest path between two real-world locations: my school and my house. By leveraging geographical data, the algorithm dynamically calculates the shortest route and visually demonstrates the search process step-by-step.

### Key Highlights
- **A* Algorithm**: Employs a highly efficient A* algorithm to explore nodes and optimize the route.
- **Geographical Data**: Uses real-world longitude and latitude data to create a map of the area.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Visualizes the exploration process and final path using Pygame, drawing the paths in real time.
- **Video Output**: Generates an MP4 video showing the complete pathfinding process, demonstrating the algorithmâ€™s performance.

## What You'll See in the Video
The generated video shows the pathfinding process, including:
- **Exploration Phase**: The A* algorithm explores possible routes.
- **Final Path Traceback**: After identifying the fastest path, the video highlights the final route in green.
